This directory contains several lists with basic Russian vocabulary (with translation into different languages). The idea is to compile basic Russian vocabulary for a later reversed sjdrus-dict.

The dicts are in GT format, sometimes with modifications.

Perhaps these files are useful for other GT projects and should live in separate directories (rusykg, etc.)?

The element <lexsample> tags a Russian lexeme's membership in a certain list:
